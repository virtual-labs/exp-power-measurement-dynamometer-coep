### Procedure

### Configuration:-
- select motor size , diameter of drum and check/click the configuration button. (we are considering standard single phase motor sizes).
- click on next level 

### Basic Knowledge - 
- Answer all the questions and click on next level.

### Simulation-

#### Part A
- Click on motor and start cold water supply.
- click on Engine and start loading the weight .
- Check the spring balance reading and calculate the power and submit the answer.
- repeat the process for 5-6 times with different loads and observe the table reading and change in power with weight.

#### Part B
- Start the cold water pump for cooling system.
- Start the induction motor with no load condition and check the power sensor reading.
- calculate the standard power (upto two decimals) for no load condition and submit the answer.
- load the weight , start induction motor and check the sensor power reading.
- calculate the standard power (upto two decimals) for load condition and submit the answer.
- Repeat the same process for loading the till the maximum weights.
- Observe the reading , calculate the standard torque for every observation and submit the answer.
- plot the graph by clicking on "show graph" button after taking atleast 5-6 readings.

### Fault Finding:
1. Observe the shown table and select the fault accordingly.
2. After selecting the correct fault Result will be displayed.
